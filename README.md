- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

One of the standout skills I acquired during this project was the ability to create custom backgrounds using Tailwind CSS. This allowed me to enhance the visual appeal of my web applications. Here's an example of how to define custom backgrounds in your Tailwind CSS configuration:

```js
backgroundImage: {
  'patterntop': "url('./images/bg-pattern-top.svg')",
  'patternbot': "url('./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg')"
}
```
